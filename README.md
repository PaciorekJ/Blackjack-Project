# Blackjack-Project

This is a game of blackjack with room for expansion into other areas such as "War" or "Texas Holdem Poker". The goal is to beat the dealer. The dealer is not allowed to give himself another card while he is at 17 or more. the goal is to get as close to 21 without going over 21. When the dealer is beat the house will match your bet, however, if you lose then the house gets to keep you money.
