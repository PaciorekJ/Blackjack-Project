# Blackjack-Project

This is a game of blackjack with room for expansion into other areas such as "War" or "Texas Holdem Poker". The goal is to beat the dealer. The dealer is not allowed to give himself another card while he is at 17 or more. the goal is to get as close to 21 without going over 21. When the dealer is beat the house will match your bet, however, if you lose then the house gets to keep you money.

### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

The most difficult part was figuring out the logic for who would win. This was hard because I needed to set up a system that would provide the correct result given multiple situations that could potentially occur. I had to develop situations for 3 different outcomes. The first being a push, neither the dealer nor the player win, the second being the dealer wins, and the third being the player wins. For each one of these I had to think critically about what could lead to this outcome. The dealer could bust, or go over 21, or the player could bust. The dealer could bust and the player could be under 21. The player could bust and the dealer could stay under 21. The dealer could have a greater number then the player (without either of them busting). The player could have a greater number then the dealer (without either of them busting).
